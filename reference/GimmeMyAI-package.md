# GimmeMyAI: Diagnostics for Multivariate Models

Provides a suite of diagnostic tools for multivariate analysis and
machine learning. This package implements visualization techniques for
dimension reduction methods through correlation circles, score plots,
and biplots. It also includes variable importance mapping to facilitate
the interpretation of latent structures and the assessment of predictive
model performance.
