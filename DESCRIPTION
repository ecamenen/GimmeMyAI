Description: Provides a suite of diagnostic tools for multivariate
    analysis and machine learning. This package implements visualization
    techniques for dimension reduction methods through correlation
    circles, score plots, and biplots. It also includes variable
    importance mapping to facilitate the interpretation of latent
    structures and the assessment of predictive model performance.
